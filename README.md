# Billy Up

**Billy Up** is an endless vertical jumping game developed using **Unreal Engine 4**, where players must strategically manage their jumps to survive and climb as high as possible. Time your movements, hit each platform, and don’t fall—or you’ll have to bounce back to regain your momentum!

## 🚀 Quick Start

To open the project in **Unreal Engine 4**, follow these steps:

1. **Clone or Download** the repository.
2. **Navigate** to the project folder.
3. **Open the project** using **Unity Editor** (Recommended version: **4.27**).

## 📋 Requirements

- **Unreal Engine 4** (Version **4.27** recommended)
- Compatible system: **Windows, macOS, or Linux**
- **C++ Development Tools** (Visual Studio for Windows or Clang/GCC for Linux/macOS)

## 🧠 Gameplay Mechanics

- You have **3 jumps** available per jump cycle.
- To refill your jumps, you must **land safely on the next platform**—or **fall back** to a previous one.
- The higher you go, the more **points** you accumulate.
- It’s a test of **timing, control, and endurance**!

## 📖 Project Experience

This version of **Billy Up** was created in **Unity** as an upgraded take on an earlier version built in **Unreal Engine 4.27**, which featured a more basic score-based system. With this new version, I focused on refining the gameplay loop, expanding the scoring mechanics, and adding a more strategic twist through limited jump attempts.

Through this project, I:
- Designed and developed a fully functional endless jumper in Unity
- Implemented custom **jump logic** with reset mechanics
- Focused on **player feedback**, physics, and fluid control
- Expanded on scorekeeping and challenge progression

This project challenged me to think differently about level design and player behavior, and helped deepen my understanding of Unity’s physics and game loop architecture.

Enjoy exploring the project! 🎮⬆️🔥
